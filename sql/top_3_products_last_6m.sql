-- Q1: Top 3 products by revenue per month (last 6 months of dataset data)
-- =============================================================================
-- Approach:
--   1. Compute MAX(invoice_date) once in dataset_max_date; reference it as a
--      scalar subquery in WHERE to filter without a join.
--      "Last 6 months" is anchored to the dataset's most recent invoice date
--      (not CURRENT_DATE) so the query is reproducible against the historical CSV.
--   2. Aggregate revenue by (month, product) in monthly_product_revenue —
--      necessary because PostgreSQL does not allow a window function and GROUP BY
--      in the same SELECT (RANK must reference the already-aggregated total_revenue).
--   3. Apply DENSE_RANK() in the outer query, then filter to rank <= 3.
--      • vs ROW_NUMBER(): arbitrarily breaks ties — two equally-ranked
--        products at position 3 would not both appear.
--      • vs RANK(): skips ranks after a tie, so two products tied at position 2
--        would make the next product rank 4, silently dropping what should be
--        the 3rd-place result.
--      DENSE_RANK() is correct here: ties share the same rank and the next
--      rank is not skipped, so the 3rd slot is always filled even when
--      positions 1 or 2 have ties.  All products that tie *at* rank 3 are
--      also included.

-- retail_transactions uses Type 2 append: every pipeline run adds rows tagged
-- with loaded_at.  The latest_batch CTE scopes all subsequent CTEs to a single
-- consistent snapshot so aggregations are not inflated by prior runs.
