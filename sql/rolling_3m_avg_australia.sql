-- Q2: Rolling 3-month average revenue for Australia
-- =============================================================================
-- Approach:
--   1. Build a complete month spine (all_months) covering the full dataset
--      date range using generate_series.  This ensures every calendar month
--      appears as a row, even if Australia had zero transactions that month.
--   2. LEFT JOIN the Australia monthly aggregates onto the spine.  Months with
--      no Australia sales get NULL monthly_revenue.
--   3. Apply ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW over the dense spine.
--      Because all months are now present, "2 rows back" always means exactly
--      2 calendar months back — no gaps can cause a row to skip over a month.
--   4. AVG() ignores NULLs, so a month with no sales is correctly excluded
--      from the average denominator (e.g. a 3-row window containing one NULL
--      averages over the 2 non-NULL months, not 3).
--
-- Why the month spine is anchored to the full dataset (not Australia-only):
--   Using the global date range guarantees the spine is consistent with other
--   queries.  Australia-only MIN/MAX would shift the spine if the country had
--   no early or late transactions, potentially hiding leading/trailing gaps.

-- retail_transactions uses Type 2 append: every pipeline run adds rows tagged
-- with loaded_at.  The latest_batch CTE scopes all subsequent CTEs to a single
-- consistent snapshot so aggregations are not inflated by prior runs.
